# Welcome to the Epic Site! [v1.13.9]
## I'm getting a custom domain, so the site will be offline for a while!
### IF SITE ISN'T WORKING, GO TO THE REPLIT VERSION!!!!!: https://epic-site.vocalnutria9174.repl.co

This is my first ever website!
Enjoy!

(If you have comments, suggestions, or problems, Please let me know in the issues page. Thanks!)
:)

Fun Fact: When I first started this site, it took me about 2Â½ MONTHS to get it to the way it was for the first release (I went through so. much. pain.)!
