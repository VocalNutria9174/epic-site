Hello!

Welcome to the Epic Site!

This is my first ever website!
Enjoy!

(If you have comments, suggestions, or problems, Please let me know in the issues page. Thanks!)
:)

Fun Fact: When I first started this site, it took me about 2Â½ MONTHS to get it to the way it was for the first release (I went through so. much. pain.) !
