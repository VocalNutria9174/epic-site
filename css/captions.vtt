00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.960
- [Reporter] Modern day pirates.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.440
They carried out
sophisticated cyber attacks

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.240
over a seven month period.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.440
- As of now there doesn't really

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.470
seem to be any one person in charge,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.485
they're called LulzSec.

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.320
- [Robotic Voice] They unite.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.387
- [Narrator] Behind one phrase,

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.807
"Respect Existence".

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:25.753
- [Robotic Voice] or "Expect Resistance".

00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:28.920
(upbeat techno music)

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.840
- [Robotic Voice 2] You
are watching disrup[tv].

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.360
- [Narrator] A teenager living in New York

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.970
picks up his parents' phone to
contact the customer support

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.177
of "World of Warcraft".

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.960
- [Boy] Oh, My God, I just ran in.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.130
- [Narrator] But instead,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.933
he gets connected to a secure FBI line.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.350
And in Detroit,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.830
an FBI officer tries to get
in touch with his officials

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.803
but instead he's connected to a toy store.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.180
LulzSec takes claim

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.260
and they received their
first stamp of authenticity.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.040
They then go on a hacking
spree to take down

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.790
the Fox News Channel, LinkedIn profiles,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.863
and the names of 73,000
"X Factor" contestants.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.513
They release the transaction
logs of 3,100 ATMs in the UK.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.400
Basically, they cause chaos for the fun

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.603
and their next move brings
them international attention.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.110
The American Public Broadcasting system

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.740
suddenly saying Tupac
Shakur and Biggie Smalls

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.693
are still alive and living in New Zealand.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.570
The hackers then use
an SQL injection method

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.810
in which malicious SQL statements

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.270
are inserted into an
entry field for execution.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.810
This tricks the software
into vulnerability

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.180
and results in Sony Pictures data,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.090
names, passwords being leaked.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.523
LulzSec motivation?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.180
Lawsuit.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.453
George Hotz, who jailbroke
the PlayStation 3.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.263
That's not fair.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.210
The members of LulzSec then
release lists of hack usernames

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.920
to inform the public
of vulnerable websites

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.210
and give them a chance

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.603
to save themselves from being exploited.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.050
On June 9th, an email
pops up on the computer

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.700
of an administrator at the
British National Health Service.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.440
The email informs them of
a security vulnerability

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.883
in the NHS system.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.363
Next, they hack into Bethesda,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.540
but they remain quiet about it.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.633
Just sit there.

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:47.750
(gentle upbeat music)

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.880
- [Man] The meerkat distracts the humans

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.224
while his sister sneaks behind.

00:03:18.224 --> 00:03:21.391
(gentle upbeat music)

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.980
An important to possession.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.570
With their winter den complete,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.534
the meerkat family now
has access to disrupt+.

00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:35.470
(gentle upbeat music)

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.380
They can stream hundreds of hours

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.068
of series, films, and podcasts.

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:43.235
(gentle upbeat music)

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.873
Plus, they've unlocked
patron-only rewards.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.463
But unfortunately for the meerkats,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.343
electricity does not
come easy in the wild.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.650
- [Narrator] Next, they
hack in to Bethesda

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.960
but they remain quiet about it.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.793
Just sit there.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.593
Until a few months later
when they tweet out.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.367
Next, they take down

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:29.990
"Minecraft", "League of
Legends", "The Escapists",

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.977
and an IT security
company called FinFisher.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.190
They try to hack into Nintendo but,

00:04:40.493 --> 00:04:41.650
a video emerges...

00:05:06.864 --> 00:05:09.670
(upbeat techno music)

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.740
- [Narrator] The attack was made

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.060
on a nonprofit organization
affiliated with the FBI.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.763
They deface the website with a message.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.460
On June 13th, they decided to step it up

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.150
and release the emails and passwords

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.583
of a number of users of the US Senate.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.900
Stakes escalate even further

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.450
when a plane attack of
the CIA is committed.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.603
On June 15th, the website goes offline.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.620
But internally,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.823
all the systems are sent
into an immediate lockdown.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.243
The event makes headlines.

00:05:45.996 --> 00:05:48.333
LulzSec claimed responsibility.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.363
And at 8:00 PM, they release their clutch.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.660
Then begins their largest event yet

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.700
as they team up with Anonymous

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.573
and declare full cyber warfare.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.560
Multiple releases from LulzSec
encourage their supporters

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.380
to steal and publish
classified information

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.993
and leave the term, "Antisec",
as a mark of intrusion.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.670
By 11:00 AM the database of
Serious Organised Crime Agency,

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.590
a national law enforcement
office in the UK is compromised

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.190
and their website is taken down.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.580
The team there exhaust all their resources

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.510
to bring the website back online,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.453
just to witness another
attack later that day.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.930
It takes another 24 hours

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.230
for them to get their website back online,

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.800
only to find fully vandalized
with the term, "Antisec".

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.170
What follows is a game of cat and mouse

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.130
because on the 21st of June,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.350
the London Metro Police arrested
19-year-old from Wickford

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.023
locally known as Ryan.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.133
LulzSec denies any
association with the man.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.010
On the 22nd of June,

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.540
the Brazilian unit of LulzSec comes online

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.450
as they take down two government websites.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.870
Personal information of the President

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.743
and the Mayor of Sao Paulo is made public.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.870
On June 25th, we see their last data dump.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.080
It contains numerous information

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.633
from Sony, Viacom, and Disney
to EMI and NBC Universal.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.180
For the next month, LulzSec is
fairly quiet until July 18th

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.170
when a British newspaper,
The Sun, is hacked.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.610
Their website is redirected to the Times

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.190
whose website has also been
hacked to resemble The Sun.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.980
An uproar is instigated

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.620
when a fake story is
posted to the fake Sun

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.750
reporting that Rupert Murdoch,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.363
owner of both The Sun
and The Times, has died.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.200
The disbandment of LulzSec
comes as a surprise.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.660
The number of enemy hackers

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.823
who wanted to reveal their
identities increased over time.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.710
A Pastebin post in June,
2011, from hacker KillerCube

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.710
identified LulzSec's
Sabu as Hector Monsegur.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.070
And later that month,

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.100
a group called at Team Web Ninjas appears

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.230
with the goal of identifying
all members of LulzSec

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:34.253
on behalf of the victims
of the group's hacks.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.220
Then another hacker, Oneiroi,

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.713
takes down the group's
website and Twitter page.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:44.800
On that same day, the
Guardian publishes leaked logs

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.530
from one of the group's IRC channels.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.610
Soon, another group called the A team

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.143
claims to have the full
list of all LulzSec members.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.100
- [Narrator] The London
Metro Police and the FBI

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.303
are in full investigative swing.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.780
They execute a search warrant.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.303
- [Robotic Voice 2] And find redacted.

00:09:14.257 --> 00:09:16.570
- [Narrator] Who denies ever
being a member of LulzSec

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.266
but admits to chatting with members.

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:21.123
- [FBI Agent] So, here's the thing,

00:09:22.492 --> 00:09:25.417
we need you to chat with them.

00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:28.170
You know, we need you
to re-engage with them.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.370
- [Man] I can't do that.

00:09:30.262 --> 00:09:31.745
- [FBI Agent] Why?

00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:33.930
- [Man] They all hate me.
:(

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.151
- [Narrator] So, soon
the FBI tracks down Sabu

00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:38.053
in the lower East Side of New York.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.050
Over the following seven
months, Sabu, pleads guilty

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.800
and agrees to work with them
to unmask the other members.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.513
18-year-old male from Shetland, Topiary.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.533
Kayla identified in London.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.850
Two other arrests are made

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.733
in the Scotland Yard in
Wiltshire and South Yorkshire.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.873
Then Tflow, followed
by Pwnsauce in Ireland.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.250
Today, only one of the core seven members

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.830
has not been identified yet, Avunit.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.350
After all is said and done

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.313
LulzSec releases one final statement,

00:10:25.637 --> 00:10:27.673
"50 days of Lulz".

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.810
- [Narrator] They claim they
only planned to be active

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.810
for 50 days within which they
wanted to 'cause as much chaos

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.250
for the Lulz.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.313
- [Narrator] Then, their
website goes offline.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.480
Every last piece of digital evidence

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.735
is wiped from the internet

00:11:02.735 --> 00:11:06.663
and the information highway
continues flowing on,

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.547
leaving them behind in
virtual chaotic myth.

00:11:14.228 --> 00:11:16.811
(gentle music)

00:11:19.506 --> 00:11:22.673
(lively upbeat music)
