<h1>About the site.</h1>
<p>This site was just a fun project that I had decided to do a little while ago. I had just started this just to give me something to do. But the site is made entirely
  out of HTML5, Along with a pinch of JavaScript, And CSS. But I will keep updating this site. But so far, I have been working on this project (including before I
  had figured out that I could just upload this on Github.) for about 3 Months. I had actually used a text editor, and my computer files to make the site, but then I had
  put the site on Git hub. And That's about it.</p>
  
  <p>Site was made only by: <b>VocalNutria9174</b></p>
